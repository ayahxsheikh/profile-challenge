## Profile 
## Description 
The project this week is to create a personal portfolio page that I will be able to use to showcase curent and future projects throught my frontend web-development journey. 

It is essentially a significant part of job seraching and without a funcitiong portfolio the sucess rates are lower than compared to a working minimal problematic website.

My portfolio is a work in progress as I am on my journey to learning more about CSS and Media Quries amongs other important elements to Frontend Development. I am hoping to drascially improve the functionality of the page and dedicate necessary time to make it to the best of my ability.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage 
The website should be easy to nagvigate.
The code has been edited to include HTML semantics and has modified the linked type selectors in the CSS file.
The site should clearly showcase my projects and this gives employers a good perspective of what my coding and UI abilities are capable of.
